## What is InfernoTD

This is a project created for digital prototyping (DECO2300) in order to explore the various prototyping phases and techniques that occour in the development process. 

Inferno TD is a tower defence game where you have to place towers in order to stop demons from escaping hell. The game incorporates physical interaction through having the main interaction being handled through a lego game mat and blocks. Instead of using the computer to place towers you will place blocks onto the lego mat. This blocks represent towers in the game and will appear once the user places the block on the mat.

## How it works

InfernoTD was built in unity and used a block mat with pieces and a webcam for the physical component. The webcam is pointed down over the block mat and recognized the color and size of the blocks placed. Once they are down for a long enough time to ensure it wasn't a mistake, the place appears in game if the player has enough money.

## Towers

The game currently has three towers. 

1. The first in a standard black and white tower that can be placed by playing the white block and costs $30. It has two upgrade paths allowing you to focus on either damage or attack speed. 
2. The second tower is an orange plasma tower that can be played by playing to 2 x 1 orange block. This tower costs $130 and is the only tower that can damage sheilded enemies.

3. The final tower is a purple cannon that has very high damage and a low attack speed. It can be played by placing the 2 x 2 purple block on the mat and costs $180. It is the only tower that can detect invisible enemies.
